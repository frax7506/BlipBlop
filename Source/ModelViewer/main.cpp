	/*
	 * A note about strings:
	 * Strings in C++ are terrible things. They come in a variety of formats which causes issues.
	 * The reason for this is that, as a programmer, you would want one string format that can
	 * handle ALL languages of the world (and more).
	 * There have been an ongoing attempt since 1980 that has tried to unify how strings are
	 * treated but this has over the years resulted in five major formats; ANSI, UTF-8, UTF-16,
	 * UTF-16BE and UTF-16LE. None of these are compatible with the others 1=1.
	 * The most modern type is UTF-8 and this is also what many modern libraries expect (ImGui,
	 * FMOD, FBX SDK, etc). Windows defaults to UTF-16LE because Microsoft was one of the first
	 * to adopt the unified standard well before UTF-8 was invented, and it's difficult to change
	 * a whole operating systems string handling. To make matters worse there are also different
	 * Code Pages for the oldest string encoding, ANSI, to allow for different languages. Microsoft
	 * really did their best in a world where people could not agree on a unified String representation.
	 *
	 * To avoid weird problems with compatibility, mangled characters and other problems it is highly
	 * recommended to store everything as UTF-8 encoded strings whenever possible. This means that
	 * when we store i.e. the name of a Model, Level, Sound File, etc we do so in a UTF-8 formatted
	 * std::string, and when we need to communicate with the Windows (or DirectX) API we need to use
	 * std::wstring which represents a UTF-16LE string.
	 *
	 * I have provided functions available for conversion between these formats in the str namespace in
	 * StringHelpers.h. The library can convert both from and to ACP, Wide (UTF-16LE) and UTF-8
	 *
	 * acp_to_utf8		- Converts Application Code Page strings to UTF-8. ACP strings come from
	 *					  Windows A-apis like GetWindowTextA() or reading text from Windows Console.
	 *					  LPSTR type in Windows.
	 *
	 * wide_to_utf8		- Converts Wide-string strings to UTF-8. Wide-string (wstring) come from
	 *					  more modern Windows APIs like GetWindowTextW(). LPWSTR type in Windows and
	 *					  std::wstring / wchar_t in STL.
	 *
	 * The provided Logging library expects UTF-8 format strings which should provide minimal headaches
	 * for any involved situation. For anything non-unicode (like non swedish signs, accents, etc) you
	 * can usually use normal strings as you would anywhere since UTF-8 is assumed.
	 *
	 * SetConsoleOutputCP(CP_UTF8) tells the Windows Console that we'll output UTF-8. This DOES NOT
	 * affect file output in any way, that's a whole other can of worms. But if you always write and
	 * read your strings in the same format, and always treat them as byte blocks, you'll be fine.
